# Emulating Photo Film Filters

In this repo, I have created an image filter which emulates some of the camera photo films. It converts the image or the camera feed into one of the photo-film themes to give you a feel of those cameras with really nice filters.


## How To Use
Simply clone this repo, and in your terminal run the <code>camera.py</code> script. Your webcam will be activated and the camera feed will display the output.

## Available Photo-Film filters
- Kodak Portra
- Fuji Provia
- Fuji Velvia
- Cross-processing
